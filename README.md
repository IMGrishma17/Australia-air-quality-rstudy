# Australian Air Quality Analysis (R Markdown Report)

This repository contains a statistical analysis of Australian air quality data using **R** and **R Markdown**. The analysis is based on the Air_Quality dataset and focuses on relationships between air quality, temperature, population, and geography across different Australian states and regions.

## Project Summary

The report addresses the following research questions:

1 **Relationship between state and proximity to natural reserves**  
2 **Comparison of mean Air Quality Index (AQI) between NSW and VIC**  
3 **94% confidence interval for difference in mean temperature (inland vs coastal regions) in QLD**  
4 **Variation in mean temperature among NSW regions at different coastal distances**  
5 **Linear relationship between population size and PM2.5 levels in NSW (for Traffic Density ratings 4 or 5)**  
6 **Assessment of model fit for the above linear relationship**  
7 **Interval estimate for AQI when humidity is 84**  
8 **Critical discussion of sample representativeness, data quality, and potential biases**
